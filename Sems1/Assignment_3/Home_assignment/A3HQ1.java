/* Write a java program that plays the popular scissor-rock-paper game. (A scissor can cut
a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can wrap a rock.) The program
randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor, rock, and paper. The
program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating
whether the user or the computer wins, loses, or draws.
Here are sample runs:
scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 1
The computer is scissor. You are rock. You won
scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): 2
The computer is paper. You are paper too. It is a draw */
