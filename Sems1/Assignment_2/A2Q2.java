/*
 The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a java program
to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimetres.
Hint:
1km=1000meter, 1km=3280.8399feet, 1km= 39370.0787 inch,
1km= 100000 centimetre
Here is the sample run:
    Enter the distance in km=165
    165 km is 165000 meters
    165 km is 541338.5835 feet
    165 km is 6496062.9854999995 inch
    165 km is 16500000 centimetres
